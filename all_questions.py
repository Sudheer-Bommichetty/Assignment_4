A homeowner who meets rule (1) in this instance may also have a degraded annual income under rule (3) and be designated as the defaulted borrower (DB = Yes). However, because a person's unique qualities may stimulate several rules, this fact does not render the rules mutually inconclusive." 
    answers["(b) explain"] = "A case (instance) cannot satisfy more than one rule in a mutually exclusive rule scenario, which is any rule that does not apply in that particular context. It overlaps with another one here. Consequently, a person with a low annual income (L= Yes) may also be a home owner (H= Yes), meeting both requirements that a defaulted borrower (DB = yes) ought to have. Since multiple rules might direct an individual's actions, they might not be mutually exclusive in this situation."
    answers["(c) explain"] = "The sequence of the rules may therefore affect the final categorization outcome because they are not independent. When a situation is subject to many rules, the order determines which rule applies first, affecting the default borrower's ultimate reaction. Ranking the rules guarantees consistently equitable outcomes."
    answers["(d) explain"] = "If one excludes instances when the rules as provided are not followed, the rule set is incomplete. Unmatched cases must be classified using the classes. The catch-all default class will ensure that all cases, including those that don't fit under any particular set of rules, are covered by this categorization. Some of the people will continue to be unclassified if there is no default class. In a rule-based system where the ultimate goal is to generate precise forecasts, that is undesirable."

Every entry in the data collection will be evaluated, and at least one rule will categorize every one of them. Furthermore, these guidelines do apply in certain circumstances.

There won't be any chance in the classification process because every example, in any order, will be classified in the same wayâ€”that is, as a reflection of one of the rules being followed.

Since all of the instances of each class are densely packed together in the available space, K, which has a small value, is considered the best option in this type of situation. Since there aren't many neighbors involved at this point, where K = 1 offers somewhat superior performance, this kind of error in judgment is actually quite unusual. Class separation is preferable to scenario A, however K=50 might be excessive in this instance and oversmooth the decision boundary, thus the second option would be preferable."
    answers["(b) explain"] = "Due to noise and class overlapping, each occurrence of a class is not always indicative of the general class distribution, as shown by Figure KNN (b), which displayed the greater overlapping space between the classes. Since the classifier's conclusion is based on a larger range of neighbors, a huge k would be better in this case since it eliminates the sound effect of noise. A suitable balance would be K = 5, which is detailed enough to adjust to the complexity of genuine class boundaries better than K = 50, which might be too smooth and lead to the model underfitting, but avoids a smoother decision boundary from being overly sensitive to outliers, as it is for K = 1.
